## Installation

ClamAV Prometheus Exporter requires a [supported release of Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy).

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/r3kzi/clamav-prometheus-exporter
```

To find out where `clamav-prometheus-exporter` was installed you can run `$ go list -f {{.Target}} github.com/r3kzi/clamav-prometheus-exporter`.

For `clamav-prometheus-exporter` to be used globally add that directory to the `$PATH` environment setting.

You could also build the binary yourself running:

```shell
$ make build
```

## Flags

[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) server to connect to:

```shell
Usage of clamav-prometheus-exporter:
  -clamav-address string
      ClamAV address to use (default "localhost")
  -clamav-port int
      ClamAV port to use (default 3310)
  -log-level string
      Set the level of logging. (options: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic) (default "info")
  -network string
      Network mode to use, typically tcp or unix (socket) (default "tcp")
```

## Prometheus config

Just scrape this, e.g.:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'clamav-prometheus-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9810']
```

## Release

For a new version of the application, bump version in the [VERSION](./VERSION) file.

>[!NOTE]
>The version in the file must follow the [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) pattern: `X.Y.Z`.

This will trigger a  [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/docker-build.yml) that will be responsible
for creating a new image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rekzi/clamav-prometheus-exporter)
in the pattern: `rekzi/clamav-prometheus-exporter:X.Y.Z`

In addition, a Release will be created in the repository in addition to the version patch increment,
following the pattern: `X.Y.Z-snapshot`

Pull requests are welcome.
